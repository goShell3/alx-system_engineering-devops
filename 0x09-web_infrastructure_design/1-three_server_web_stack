A three-server web infrastructure that hosts www.foobar.com

Components:
- 2 servers for Web (Nginx) + App (your code base)
- 1 load balancer (HAProxy)
- 1 MySQL database with Primary-Replica setup
- Domain name: foobar.com with A record for www pointing to Load Balancer IP

How it works:
1. User enters www.foobar.com → DNS resolves to Load Balancer IP.
2. Load Balancer (HAProxy) distributes request using Round Robin to one of the two web servers.
3. Each server runs Nginx and the Application server (code base).
4. Application servers interact with MySQL database (Primary-Replica cluster).
   - Primary handles writes; Replica handles reads.
5. Response flows back through Nginx → Load Balancer → User.

Why each component:
- Load Balancer: Distributes traffic, improves availability.
- Two App/Web servers: Scalability and redundancy.
- Primary-Replica DB: Improves read performance and fault tolerance.

Load Balancer:
- Uses Round Robin algorithm.
- This is an Active-Active setup (both servers handle traffic).
- Contrast: Active-Passive has standby server waiting for failover.

Database:
- Primary handles writes.
- Replica used for read-only queries, synced with Primary via replication.

Issues:
- SPOF: If Load Balancer goes down, entire app is unavailable.
- No HTTPS: Communication is not encrypted, vulnerable to interception.
- No firewall: All ports may be exposed to attackers.
- No monitoring: No alerts for failure, high load, or unusual activity.
