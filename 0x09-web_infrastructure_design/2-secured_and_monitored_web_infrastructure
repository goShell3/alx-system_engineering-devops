A secured and monitored web infrastructure hosting www.foobar.com

Components:
- 3 servers: Load Balancer, 2 Web/App Servers
- 1 SSL certificate for HTTPS on www.foobar.com
- 3 firewalls (one per server)
- 3 monitoring clients (one per server)
- MySQL database with Primary and Replica setup

How it works:
1. User accesses https://www.foobar.com → DNS resolves to Load Balancer IP.
2. Load Balancer terminates SSL and forwards requests to web/app servers via round-robin.
3. App servers process requests and read/write from MySQL database.
4. Monitoring agents collect and forward system and application metrics to a monitoring service.

Why the added components:
- Firewalls: Restrict unauthorized access, secure the network.
- SSL: Encrypts user-server traffic to prevent eavesdropping.
- Monitoring: Collects performance metrics, helps detect failures early.

Monitoring QPS:
- Enable and parse Nginx logs or use Nginx metrics exporter.
- Use tools like SumoLogic or Prometheus to visualize queries per second (QPS).

Issues:
- SSL termination at LB: Leaves internal traffic unencrypted unless HTTPS is used end-to-end.
- Single writable DB: SPOF — database unavailability halts write operations.
- Mixed-role servers: Blurs architectural boundaries, complicates scaling and increases risk.
