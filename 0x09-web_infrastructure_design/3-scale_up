A scalable web infrastructure that hosts www.foobar.com with:

Components:
- 2 Load Balancers (HAProxy) in active-passive cluster
- 2 Web Servers (Nginx)
- 2 Application Servers
- 1 MySQL Database Server
- 1 Additional Server (for horizontal scaling or HAProxy clustering)
- Domain: www.foobar.com pointing to floating IP for HAProxy cluster

Rationale:
- Load Balancer Cluster: Prevents single point of failure at the entry point.
- Web Server Separation: Static content handled separately for efficiency.
- App Server Isolation: Backend code is isolated and scalable independently.
- Dedicated DB: Ensures consistency and optimizes data operations.
- Additional Server: Increases fault tolerance and scalability.

Web Server vs App Server:
- Web Server (e.g., Nginx): Handles static files, SSL, reverse proxy.
- App Server (e.g., Gunicorn, Node): Runs dynamic backend code.
